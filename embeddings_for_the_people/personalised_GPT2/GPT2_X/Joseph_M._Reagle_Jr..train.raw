It also now  supports XPath subset node list canonicalization. However it presently  doesn't support:       1. Unicode -- not sure how to get eg6 to work correctly in python.   (Reagle)    Furthermore, it includes the following bugs thought to be in the DOM  implementation Ft.Lib.pDomlette: (Reagle)       1. does not white space normalize attributes of type NMTOKEN and ID?       2. seems to be include "\n" after importing external entities?
