        Steven,    Looking on the WAI lists, I see a variety of responses, particularly in the   thread started by Aaron Leavanthal on 24 April 2001. [1]    For example:  Gregory Rosmaita thinks it should be user configurable. [2]  Masafumi Nakane thinks we should take a conservative approach and *not*   activate. [3]  Kelly Ford makes a distinction between a button (activate) and a link   (focus). [4]    I would ask the UAWG.  They have a variety of test suites for accesskey   [5,6] and UA behavior is the primary topic of UAAG.    --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001AprJun/0241.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999OctDec/0725.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001AprJun/0274.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001AprJun/0253.html  [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/cp0101/0101-ACCESSKEY.html  [6] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/  At 10:52 AM 9/27/02, Steven Pemberton wrote:    >Editing the XHTML 2 spec, I came across something I wasn't sure of.  >  >If an access key is on a link, should the access key take you to the link,  >where you must then activate the link (with return or space or whatever), or  >should it immediately follow the link.  >  >HTML 4 says follow the link, but I note that UAs aren't consistent here.
