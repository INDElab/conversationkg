      Hi Gregor,    Thanks for writing.  Please respond to this letter even if you agree with  its content since Joseph has asked that we document positive acknowledgement  of the resolution of issues raised by the WG (esp. if we intend the  resolution to be not to change anything).    First, note that there is no requirement to use XPath to build the required  part of C14N.  One's implementation must only behave in the same way, which  includes replacing the CDATA sections with their character content.  The  section about text nodes that you cited [XPath, Section 5.7] mentions CDATA  sections in the discussion of text nodes, but it is in order to say  *exactly* the same thing we are saying:    "Character data is grouped into text nodes. As much character data as  possible is grouped into each text node: a text node never has an  immediately following or preceding sibling that is a text node."    "Each character within a CDATA section is treated as character data."    I believe it is best to make it clear up front that CDATA sections will be  replaced rather than burying it in text node processing because it is easier  for people who don't implement with XPath to see what must be done to make a  logically equivalent structure appropriate to their purposes.    My opinion is that the discussion of the processing model should be based on  the data model, unencumbered by details of how to create the data model.  To  me, this is esp. important given that some may choose to actually implement  based on XPath (e.g. in order to perform document subsetting), and such  people want to read the processing model to figure out how to process the  data structure they have.    As to your point about whether this concatenation is a common feature of XML  processors, hopefully it is clear that it doesn't matter.  Concatenation of  successive blocks of character data is a trivial task.  Implementers can  either choose to do it in their data structure, or they can acknowledge that  since they are consecutive in the input, simply outputing the text as  encountered suffices.    It is important to note that while many processors may report separate  character blocks for CDATA sections, they are not required (and some do not)  distinguish that the text came from a CDATA section because:    "CDATA sections may occur anywhere character data may occur; they are used  to escape blocks of text containing characters which would otherwise be  recognized as markup."  [XML, Section 2.7]    (In other words, CDATA sections are a simple escaping mechanism).

Wouldn't it be better to skip this requirement and instead  add a sencence to the explanation how to serialize Text nodes  in section 2.2?    The XPath data model also mentions CDATA sections in the  explanation of the data model [1].
