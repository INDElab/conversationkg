        Purpose  =======    Clarify conformance between the RDF working drafts and charmod (and any  other I18N issues).      I would build an agenda around an intro to the RDF graph for the I18N people  and then the three I18N issues that we have identified:  - xmllang  - normalization of string literals (NFC)  - IURI, IRI, URI in rdf    There is a further topic which is N-triples and what are its I18N needs.  DaveB, can you give a five minute intro to N-triples at our meeting - what  its purpose and scope are, rather more than what the syntax is.
