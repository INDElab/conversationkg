      Hello,    Checkpoint 3.8 in the 18 August Guidelines [1] includes the  sentence "Advise the user to refresh content according to   the same schedule as the automatic refresh, and indicate   when the user has not yet refreshed content." The  term "prompt" appears in checkpoints 9.2 and 1.5. The terms  "alert" and "notification" are used in checkpoint 1.5.    I propose the following:    1) That we only use the term "notify" in the checkpoints and     that we define it to mean "inform the user through the user     interface". Note that I do not talk about APIs here. That     is a separate requirement (that messages through the UI also     be available through an API).    2) That "notify" be independent of a particular mechanism     in the user interface (but that any notification be     accessible).    3) That the term "prompt" be reserved for a particular     UI approach, but that we don't attempt to define it!     I would note that the AU Guidelines [2] includes a definition      of prompt, but since then, that WG has had a number of discussions     on the definition (refer to [3], [4], [5], and [6] at least).    4) In checkpoint 3.8, rewrite the sentence cited above to     be "Notify the user ..."    5) We could rewrite checkpoint 9.2 to not use the word prompt:         Allow configuration so the user can confirm any form        submission not caused by explicit activation of a        form submit control.       Otherwise, if we intend to use prompt to mean "the user     must intervene before anything else happens", we should     define it to mean that. I want to avoid having to     define it.    6) What techniques, if any, do we need for notification or     configuration of notification in general?       a) Configuration to have no notification.     b) Configuration to prompt the user and require input        before continuing.     c) Configuration to notify the user but without requiring        any input from the user.     - Ian       [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000818/  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000AprJun/0199.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000AprJun/0168.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000AprJun/0073.html  [6] http://www.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000AprJun/0080.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783
